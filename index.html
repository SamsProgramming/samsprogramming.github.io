							<p class="card-text">This game is a little light on game mechanics, as it could benefit from the likes of power ups and such, I instead focused on advanced functionality such as menus, high scores and achievements. </p>
							<p class="card-text">The core mechanic is dodging pit falls, which are an instant game over, and dodging obstacles, as hitting them will move the helicopter that chases the player closer. This game has both first and third person modes, as well as a bonus perspective from the helicopter. </p>

This game was made to function on both PC and Android, as well as include game analytics via the use of <a href="https://gameanalytics.com/">GameAnalytics</a>.</p>
							<p class="card-text">This game has a few minor issues, such as imperfect mobile controls, but it was a great learning experience, as I got to work with triggers, particle systems and having to write platform specific code. </p>
							<p class="card-text">The game is simple, fight six types of enemies as you progress towards a final boss at the end of each level. Collect power ups for upgrades. </p>

                            <p class="card-text">My final year project was a level generator whose purpose is to generate a level from scratch with just a script and parameters supplied by the user. </p>
							<p class="card-text">It generates the level by creating rooms using vertices, triangles, meshes, materials and colliders, and arranges these rooms by getting random, unique coordinates that must connect together, and repeating this for additional floors, or secret rooms, if the user desires so. </p>
							<p class="card-text">The algorithm does have all the functionality it needs, albeit some of it is unfinished, as deadlines prevented me from getting features such as door raycasting completed to perfection. </p>
